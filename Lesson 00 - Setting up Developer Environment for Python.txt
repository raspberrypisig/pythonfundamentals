Steps to set up python dev environment. 

1. Install Python 3 from https://python.org
(Don't forget to tick option 'Add Python 3.X to PATH' in the installer). Also note where python is being installed on your computer, you will need this information later.

2. Open Idle
   a) File->new
   b) Try simple program 
   
   print("hello world")
   
   c) Save file and Run(F5)
   d) If it prints hello world, all is well. 

3. Install notepad++ from https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ 
   a) Open Notepad++
      File->new
      type print("hello world")
      save file as helloworld.py
   b) Plugins->Plugins Manager-> Show Plugin Manager
   c) Find one called NPPExec
   d) Tick the checkbox beside it and click Install
   e) Now you need to know the full path of the python.exe file. You can use a tool like Everything (https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/)
   On my computer, the path is C:\Python34\python.exe. If you locate the file in File Explorer, you can press SHIFT and right-click onthe file, you get an option called Copy as Path.
   f) Plugins->NPPExec->Execute
   g) In the dialog box, enter the following, replacing the full python.exe path
   "C:\Python34\python.exe" "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)" 
   h) Press Save, give script name of runpython, then OK
   i) Plugins->NppExec->Save all files on execute 
   j) If done correctly, you should see hello world in console output
   k) change program to print("I have configured Notepad++ correctly.")
   l) Press Ctrl F6

 4. Other good editors are Sublime Text, VSCode
